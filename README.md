## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights:
ðŸ”¹Top 10 paying customers drive a significant portion of
revenue

ðŸ”¹ Revenue peaked was in October, but dropped in February and November. I went ahead to check the total cost of orders for each month and found that February had low orders.

ðŸ”¹Cash payment method accounted for $22.6k(39.3%) followed by Credit card $17.8k(30.83%) and online payment $17.2k (29.87%).

ðŸ”¹Mending and stain removal services generated the most
revenue

ðŸ”¹ Washer accounted for $29.2k(50.7%) and dryer $28.4k(49.3%), usage is almost balance.

## ðŸ”— Recommendations:
1. Reward top-paying customers with coupons and send message reminders to customers.
2. Run seasonal promotions, like efficient drying deals during the rainy February and holiday bundles in November to attract and retain customers.
3. Create services packages that include high performing services and low performing services like (e.g Stain removal +Laundry)
4. Optimize batch scheduling to reduce cost and maintenance.
